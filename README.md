== European Citizen Initiative

Great concept, badly supported by a softare to collect signatures that is citizen and campaigners hostile.

This tiny software is there to help checking the quality of signatures you've collected online. More specifically, it converts the insane xml format generated by the OCS software into a csv, so you can import it into excel.

It doesn't export all the data, like for instance the id number, because we didn't need it for our check, and because the best way not to loose any sensitive data is to avoid having them in the first place.

Anyway, if you need to export new fields, simply alter the keys line and add them.

=== how to use
From the command line, simply
php xml.php nameofthexmlfile.xml

Good luck. you'll need it.
